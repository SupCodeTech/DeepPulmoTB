# DeepPulmoTB


DeepPulmoTB is a comprehensive Tuberculosis lesion tissue segmentation dataset. In DeepPulmoTB, for each patient, a series of images consists of about 125 slices in the axial projection. For the consolidation and lung cavity segmentation categories, the data are sourced from ImageCLEF2022 TB Cavern detection and cavern report, totaling 759 patient CT images (approximately 95k CT slice images). For the Lung Area Mask (Mask version III) segmentation category, there are a total of 2516 patient CT images (approximately 314k CT slice images), combining Mask versions I and II from the ImageCLEF 2020-2022 TB challenge.
Examples of DeepPulmoTB are shown in Figure 1.
